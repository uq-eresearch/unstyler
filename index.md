So, that point in your project comes, and you need to handle copy & paste from
Microsoft Word. At first, it looks great... and then you look at the HTML!

This library is an alternative to using a mature WYSIWYG editor that
incorporates "Paste from Word".

## Demo

{% include example.html %}

## Dependencies

JQuery is used on this page but only to get the content to manipulate.
